## Bulit with
   The below languages are used to built the project
   
    1.html
    2.php
    3.java script
    4.css



## Prerequisites
 To run the project, you will need a web server that supports PHP and MySQL. You will also need a MySQL database to store the login credentials.

 Here in this project I prefer to use XAMPP v3.3.0

 XAMPP is a free and open-source software package that provides an easy way to set up a web server environment on your local machine. It includes Apache (a web server), PHP (a programming language), and MySQL (a database management system).

 
 
## Installation

1.Download and install XAMPP v3.30 from the official website.
2.Start the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.
3.Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin. 4.Create a new MySQL database by clicking on the "New" button on the left-hand side and giving your database a name.

5.Select the newly created database from the list on the left-hand side and click on the "Import" tab.
6.Click on the "Choose File" button and select the database.sql file located in the project's database folder.
7.Click on the "Go" button to import the SQL file and create the necessary tables for the login credentials.
8.Copy the project files to the htdocs folder in your XAMPP installation directory (usually located in C:\xampp\htdocs).


9.Edit the database connection details in the index.html file to match your MySQL database configuration.



## Sql Connection(From code)
 <?php
  $con= mysqli_connect("localhost","pranathi","password","database");
   $n1=$_GET['username'];
   $p1=$_GET['password'];
   $dt="insert into table2(username1,password1) values('$n1','$p1')";
   mysqli_query($con,$dt);
?>
  

$con= mysqli_connect("localhost","pranathi","password","database"):

  Syntax : mysqli_connect($host, $username, $password, $databasename); 


##  run XAMPP
In your web browser, navigate to http://localhost/project-folder-name (replace "project-folder-name" with the name of the folder where you copied the project files).
The project should now be up and running, and you can use the login credentials stored in the MySQL database to log in.

 


## Usage
To use the project, you can follow these steps:

1.Open the index.php file in your browser to access the login form.

2.Enter your username and password and click on the "Login" button.
If the login is successful, you will be redirected to the puzzle.html file.
3.Play the Uncovering the Secrets: The Ultimate Treasure Hunt Adventure and have fun!
